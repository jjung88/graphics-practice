# graphics-practice
miscellaneous projects relating to computer graphics .

This repository is meant to keep track of my progress and get comfortable with using github. 
I'll likely be using a mix of python and c++ for my projects whilst primarily getting inspiration from the book: 
"Raytracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley, Trevor D Black, and Steve Hollasch.
